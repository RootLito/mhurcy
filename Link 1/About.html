                <h2>I'm Mercy <span>Ann</span></h2>
                <p>     I'm a grade 12 ICT student at Davao del Sur School of
                    <br>Fisheries. I'm 17 years old, turning 18 in August.
                    <br>I'm currently residing at Purok 3, Ibo, Malalag, Davao
                    <br>del Sur. In the future, I wish to work in computer engineering.
                    <br>Playing online games, watching anime and random videos online,
                    <br>doing sketches and reading books are some of my pastimes.
                    <br>I love my cats more than I love most people. Of all the
                    <br>things God created, from sunrise and rainbows, to black holes 
                    <br>and humor, cats are the most fascinating to me. 
                    <br>I'm a lazy person, I simply like spending the entire day in
                    <br>bed scrolling through my phone. However, if I have anything 
                    <br>important to accomplish, particularly if it involves
                    <br>schoolwork, I will get to it quickly. Sometimes, on the day when
                    <br>the schoolwork's deadline falls, I work nonstop all day and
                    <br>night long on it without eating or resting.
                    <br>I'M NOT AFRAID OF DYING, I'M AFRAID OF FAILING! Sheeessshhh.
